DONE 1. import features data into model, create a db of features

2. create script that generates C program from feature data, compiles
C program into a python runnable module. no data load, all read into
program memory

3. load and call this module with new sequence

4. gets back a list of fragments, compile them into features

5. save features into db for sequence

6. output raphaeljs from features list

7. figure out how to test 4-5, give sequence, do we have expected
features

8. figure out how to test 1-3, change db of features, do we have the
right module? may need to include 4-5.

9. figure out how to test 6

issues to address later:

  - if new module is available, re generate features list
  - keep access time
  - create different modules with different sets of features
