DONE 1. import features data into model, create a db of features

DONE 2. create script that generates C program from feature data,
compiles C program into a python runnable module. no data load, all
read into program memory

3. load and call this module with new sequence
  - XXX how to call executable w/o hard-coded path

4. gets back a list of fragments, compile them into features

5. save features into db for sequence
  - XXX sequence trim removes all whitespaces
  - XXX how do we serialize this and return to user? do we want to
	return sequence? NO. do we want to return feature sequence?
	probably yes.

6. output raphaeljs from features list

7. figure out how to test 4-5, give sequence, do we have expected
features

8. figure out how to test 1-3, change db of features, do we have the
right module? may need to include 4-5.

9. figure out how to test 6

issues to address later:

  - if new module is available, re generate features list
  - keep access time
  - create different modules with different sets of features
