Use the following steps to generate new feature database. For each feature
database, we create two files, a .data file for the frags program, stored in
../frags/data, and the corresponding features database records, in Django
initial_data.json fixture. These two things go hand in hand; should they go out
of sync with each other, all hell will break loose.

How to generate feature database
--------------------------------

List of features to be detected are stored in ./features/.

mk_db.sh groups features into feature databases.

If you make changes to files in ./features/ or to mk_db.sh, you should
re-create the fixtures for this app to make the changes visible. To do
so, on a test machine, DO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING

0. Remove initial_data.json

1. Blow away data in all the models in the "blat" application

		python manage.py reset blat

2. Load feature_types.json

		python manage.py loaddata blat/fixtures/feature_types.json

3. Run mk_db.sh. mk_db.sh creates the .data files and create database instances
   in MySQL.

		All commands in mk_db.sh must RUN TOGETHER, ONCE. If that's a failure,
		you will have to restart from 1, and re-run mk_db.sh all together
		again.

4. Create new fixture
	python manage.py dumpdata blat > blat/fixtures/initial_data.json

After that, anytime you run syncdb, the new fixture will be loaded. The .data
files are already in the right place, put in there by mk_db.sh.
