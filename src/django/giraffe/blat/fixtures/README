How to generate fixtures?
-------------------------

List of features to be detected are stored in ./features/.

mk_db.sh groups features into feature databases.

If you make changes to files in ./features/ or to mk_db.sh, you should
re-create the fixtures for this app to make the changes visible. To do
so, on a test machine, DO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING

0. Remove initial_data.json

1. Blow away data in all the models in the "blat" application
	python manage.py reset blat

2. Load feature_types.json
	python manage.py loaddata blat/fixtures/feature_types.json

3. Run mk_db.sh - all commands in here must RUN TOGETHER, ONCE. If that's a
failure, you will have to restart from 1, and re-run mk_db.sh all together
again.

4. Create new fixture
	python manage.py dumpdata blat > blat/fixtures/initial_data.json

After that, anytime you run syncdb, the new fixture will be loaded.
