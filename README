Giraffe: tool for detecting popular features in DNA sequence, creating
maps of those features, and performing sequence analysis.

This software is written and copyrighted by Addgene, and released
under the MIT License. See LICENSE file.

The software is mostly divided into two parts: a Django based service that
detects features within a sequence, and a set of Javascript widgets that
visualize the sequence, features, digests, etc.

Requirement:

	gcc - part of the feature detection algorithm is in C
	python (2.7+)
	django (1.2+)
	BioPython (1.56) - ORF detection via BioPython - you can skip NumPy requirement
	MySQL, and mysql-python module

Install:

	git clone git@github.com:addgene/giraffe.git
	cd giraffe
	cd src/django/giraffe/blat/frags; gcc -O6 -o bin/frags frags.c

	mysql
	> DROP DATABASE giraffe;
	> CREATE DATABASE giraffe CHARACTER SET 'utf8'
	
	cd src/django/giraffe; python manage.py syncdb --noinput

Run test server:

	cd src/django/giraffe; python manage.py runserver

	Then visit "/"

	Click on "See an example" to see an example.

API:

	You can POST a sequence to "/blat/", with the following CGI variables:

		db=default&sequence=your_dna_sequence_here

	Then you will be redirected to a URL that looks like

		/blat/8de364690dbeb88d2ab63bd66861725539aa3204/default

	The "8de3...3204" string is the hash identifier for your sequence. You can
	use this hash identifier and this URL to retrieve features in the future
	(JSON format).
	
	Also, you can use the hash identifier with the Javascript widgets. You will
	need to load several js and css files as well. See demo.html for example --
	you can put demo.html on your local computer and load it, and see the
	sequence analysis widget show up on your browser.

	(demo.html is currently set to use neon.addgene.org:8800 as the giraffe
	server, that may be different for you)
