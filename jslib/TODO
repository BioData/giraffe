*List of basic seq routines*

 * Classes for sequence, enzymes, features
 * Feature list concept, so we can filter out features
 * Sequence
   ** Parse from FASTA, GenBank, flat
   ** Detect bad nucleotide
   ** Detect and handle degenerates
   ** Reverse comp
   ** Convert to protein
   ** GC, Tm
   ** Convert to GenBank (with features)

*List of sequence related tasks*

 * Feature detection (backend)
 * Draw map (in backend, for JPEG, and frontend Raphaelis)
 * Library of enzymes and common protein sequences
 * Convert to FASTA, GenBank, RC
 * Get cutters (from feature list)
 * Translation
 * ORF detection
 * Digest map (from feature list)
 * Annotation
 * List classes of features
 * Widget for NCBI BLAST
 * Widget for NCBI Alignment
 * Widget for NCBI Entrez/GenBank search
 * Search and import from Vector Database
 * Alignment

*Rough layout of sequence analysis widget*

 * Similar to version on LabLife
 * Paste new sequence
 * Cutter detection perhaps more JS driven, automatic
 * Feature detection comes up later, via Ajax
 * Translation: map
 * Restriction map
 * Digest map: click on cutter, show map
 * Highlight sequence where cutter is cutting, like EnzymeX
 * Show information on enzyme: how it cuts, who sells it
 * BLAST options: against different genomes
 * Option to select unique, double, triple cutters
 * Option to clone in another DNA (from saved, Entrez, etc)
 * PCR

*RNAi Tool*

 * Fetch from gene NCBI
 * Use some rule to come up with candidate sequence
 * Show %GC
 * Run against NCBI to detect specificity

*QC Analysis*

 * Auto BLAST against NCBI
 * Show best match, check if it's the same as author's gene
 * Report mutations, silent versus non-silent
 * Based on primer, figure out portion of the vector sequenced
 * Check against database to see "QC" coverage
 * If we have a way to specify mutation or special features in our
   system, we can check for coverage against these features
   ** Either annotation of sequence, or while entering data
